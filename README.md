## Overview

Base project folder for a SilverStripe ([https://silverstripe.org](http://silverstripe.org)) installation. Required modules are installed via [https://github.com/silverstripe/recipe-cms](http://github.com/silverstripe/recipe-cms).

This recipe provides a starting point including a built-in, bootstrap based theme
combined with the [syntro/recipe-elemental-bootstrap](https://github.com/syntro-opensource/recipe-elemental-bootstrap)
recipe to provide a simple, elemental-based content editing experience.
It presents a good starting points for any web project, which is not based of
a present theme.


## Installation
Create a new Project:
```
composer create-project syntro/ssto my-app
```
Or if you do not have a local composer installation and want to use docker:
```
docker run \
    -v ${PWD}:/app \
    composer \
    create-project syntro/ssto my-app --ignore-platform-reqs
```

---
**When Installing this recipe using `create-project`, follow these steps to customize your project:**

* [ ] Rename the project in the `composer.json` file
* [ ] Adapt/delete the workflows in `.github/workflows` to suit your needs
* [ ] Create a favicon by following these steps:
    1. Place the desired logo/image in `app/client/files/favicon.png`
    2. Update colors in `faviconDescription.json` to suit your needs
    3. Run `npm run favicon`
* [ ] Replace `CHANGELOG.md` with `CHANGELOG.template.md` and correct the links
* [ ] Adapt the Theme to your needs
* [ ] Remove the sections above this message and write your own introduction

## Documentation
We employ a docker-centered approach to development. While we recommend to
install [node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
yourself, you really only need [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). After you have installed docker, you can make use of the
following commands to dive into silverstripe development.

> By default, our docker-compose setup is geared towards macOS. You can however
> gear it towards linux by using a bind volume instead of a nfs one.
> for this, simply change the volume to
> ```yaml
> x-host-volume: &host-volume
>   type: bind
>   source: ./
>   target: /var/www/html
> ```
> We are open for feedback concerning permission errors. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/syntro-opensource/silverstripe-ssto/issues)
> if you stumble upon problems!

Befor you can use the NFS-based volumes on macOS, you have to follow [these steps](https://firehydrant.io/blog/nfs-with-docker-on-macos-catalina/)
### Maintenance
#### Serving Silverstripe
To start the server via docker, run
```
docker-compose up -d host
```
This will start a host and database container running your project. To stop
it, run
```
docker-compose down
```

#### Installing dependencies

> Currently, the base Silverstripe image does not provide composer natively.
> We do not want to include a build in the development process as this might
> complicate updating this repo and especially generated projects in the long
> run. As the original composer image is missing some extensions for running
> silverstripe, you have to append `--ignore-platform-reqs` to every composer
> command

You can install dependencies by using
```
docker-compose run --rm composer require new/module --ignore-platform-reqs
```
Updating dependencies can be done with
```
docker-compose run --rm composer update --ignore-platform-reqs
```

### Theming
After installation, you can use the included theming tools to build
a Project. we use npm and recommend
[installing it](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) on your system
natively for performance reasons. You can also use docker for any step,
just prefix the command with `docker-compose run --rm`.

We use webpack as buildtool and the included
[syntro-opensource/webpack-config](https://github.com/syntro-opensource/webpack-config)
helper package allows for a simple config. Have a look at the documentation
of said module, if you need to build an additional bundle (eg. a map).

#### Installing dependencies
Before developing, you need to install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

#### Developing the theme
Run
```
npm run watch
```
to start a watcher which watches for changes and rebuilds the bundles on change.
When you are finished, run
```
npm run build
```
tu build assets for production use

#### Favicon
To override the the default favicon, place your icon (square pngs work best)
under `app/client/files/favicon.png` and run `npm run favicon`.


### Testing
By default, this recipe supplies PHPUnit, PHPCS and PHPStan for testing. you can
run the Tests by running:
```
docker-compose run --rm phpunit
```
```
docker-compose run --rm phpstan
```
```
docker-compose run --rm phpcs
docker-compose run --rm phpcbf
```
